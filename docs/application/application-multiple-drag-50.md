<applicationMultipleDrag50/>

# Dragging multiple elements at the same time 50

By default, this is not a feature provided by the component, but it is an example of how to build complex scenarios using existing functionality.

Because of the way the `ctrl` event handler is registered, make sure you click anywhere in the container before you start dragging elements.
